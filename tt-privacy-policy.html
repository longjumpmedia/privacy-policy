    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Last Updated: May 23, 2025</p>

    <p>
      At Longjump Media, we respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains
      how we handle information when you use the TT mobile app ("the App"). By
      using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>
      TT is designed for users of all ages, and we do not collect any personal
      information. Users download and access the App through the Apple App Store
      or Google Play Store, which may collect data per their own privacy
      policies.
    </p>

    <p>We do not collect:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Names, email addresses, phone numbers, or other personally identifiable
        information (PII)
      </li>

      <li>Location data</li>

      <li>Device-specific identifiers tied to personal identity</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We may use anonymized, aggregated data to understand general usage trends
      (e.g., number of users, gameplay frequency).
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>

    <p>Any non-personal, anonymous data is used solely to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improve app performance and gameplay experience</li>

      <li>Understand general user engagement trends</li>

      <li>Serve advertisements in the freemium version of the app</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Advertising</h2>

    <p>
      The freemium version of TT displays third-party ads through ad networks
      such as Google AdMob. These services may collect non-personal information
      (like approximate location or device type) to deliver relevant ads. We do
      not control third-party privacy practices and recommend reviewing their
      policies.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>

    TT is family-friendly and safe for all ages. Since we do not collect
    personal information, the app is compliant with child privacy standards,
    including COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act).

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>

    While we do not collect personal data, we still implement industry-standard
    security measures to protect the app and any anonymized usage data from
    unauthorized access or misuse.

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will
      revise the "Last Updated" date and provide in-app or website notification,
      if necessary.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
